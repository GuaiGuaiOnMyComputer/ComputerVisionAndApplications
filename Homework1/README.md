# Homework1

Homework1.exe is contained in the ```dist``` folder, along with all the relavent opencv dependencies build using cmake and g++ compiler.

The source code of opencv4.9 is cloned into ```dep/opencv``` from github, and the ```build``` directory contains the build files of opencv.

To build Homework1.exe, first build opencv with mingw and cmake, writing the build files into the ```build``` directory, and run the vscode task __g++ windows compile and copy dependecies into dist folder__. All the dlls and image asset should be copied into ```dist``` and ```Homework1.exe``` should be built.

After running ```Homework1.exe``` the output images should be stored into ```dist/output``` folder as M11225013_1.jpg__ and M11225013_2.jpg__.
